6. Creating a Visualization
===========================

The platform offers several methods of generating a new visualization from a data view.

You can create a new visualization by placing your mouse over the Visualization button from the main menu and clicking on New. This action will launch an internal lightbox from where you can choose the data view you want to use to generate the new visualization.

You can also click on the data view’s title to go into the Data Views page, and then on the Create Visualization button on the upper right side on your screen.
